    },
    introduceSelf: function () { // fourth property is a function. shows name 0
    // can rewrite introduceSelf: function() {... } to just introduceSelf() {console.log ... }
    console.log(`Hi, I"m ${this.name[0]}.`);
    },
};

*/

/*  
in the console, you can type person.name; to see the array. type person.name[0]; to see Bob. type person.age; to see 32.
person.bio(); to see Bob Smith is 32 years old. person.introduceSelf() to see Hi, I'm Bob. 

the person object has name, age, bio and introduceSelf. name and age are data items and are referred to as object properties.

bio and introduceSelf are functions that allow the object to do something with the data items. these functions are referred to
as the object's methods. 

the above lines 19 to 31 is referred to as an object literal bc we've written out all the object contents when we created it. 
later on, there will be objects instantiated from classes which is different from an object literal.

DOT NOTATION

the object's name is person. person acts as the namespace. it must be entered first to access anything inside the object. 
then you write a dot and the item you want to access. 

person.age will get the age
person.name[0] will get the first item of the array in the name
person.bio() calls the bio() function aka method

*/

// OBJECTS AS OBJECT PROPERTIES

// changing the name: ["Bob", "Smith"] to another object. so you will have a name object inside the person object. 
// also will need to change the methods to show it is not an array name[0] but is now person.name.first

/*

const person = { // new object
    name: { // the first property is a name object inside the person object
        first: "Bob",
        last: "Smith",
    },
    age: 32, // second property
    bio() { // third property is a function. it shows name 0, name 1 and age
        // remember if you want to use var's in a string with console.log you need `${ } ... `
        // can rewrite bio: function () {... } to just bio() {console.log ... }
        console.log(`${this.name.first} ${this.name.last} is ${this.age} years old.`);
    },
    introduceSelf() { // fourth property is a function. shows name 0
        // can rewrite introduceSelf: function() {... } to just introduceSelf() {console.log ... }
        console.log(`Hi, I"m ${this.name.first}.`);
    },
};

*/
    
// name: {first: "Bob", last: "Smith"}, to access this property, you use person.name.first or person.name.last 

/*
BRACKET NOTATION

person.name.first or person.age is dot notation. to use bracket notation for these it would be this: 

person["name"]["first"]
person["age"]

notice bracket notation looks similar to accessing an array. instead of using name[0] or name[1] aka using the index number, 
you use the name associated with each member's value. this is why objects are sometimes called associative arrays. they map 
strings to values in the same way that an array maps index numbers to values.

when an object property name is held in a variable, then you must use brackets to access the value. 
*/

const personBracket = { // new object
    name: ["Bob", "Smith"], // first property is an array
    age: 32, // second property
};

function logProperty(propertyName) { // new function. receives propertyName. remember propertyName is just a place holder aka 
    // namespace from the above personBracket object, it can receive either name or age. in other words, the function names the 
    // param as propertyName but what it is really receiving is name or age

    console.log(personBracket[propertyName]); // will either print personBracket's name values or age value
};

// logProperty() function can use personBracket[propertyName] to retrieve the value of the property named in propertyName. 

// logProperty("name") will show ["Bob", "Smith"]. notice when you call the function, you pass "name", not [name]. when the 
// function receives "name", then it takes that property of "name" and uses it as personBracket["name"] which is required when
// you are trying to get a value of a property when those properties are held in a variable.

// logProperty("age") will show 32. the function receives "age" and it uses it as personBracket["age"]

/* 

SETTING OBJECT MEMBERS

So far, the above notes only covered retrieving (or getting) object members. You can also set (update) the value of the object
members by declaring the member you want to set (using dot or bracket notation).

person.age = 45
person["name"]["last"]= "Cratchit"

*/

const person = { // new object
    name: { // the first property is a name object inside the person object
        first: "Bob",
        last: "Smith",
    },
    age: 32, // second property
    bio() { // third property is a function. it shows name 0, name 1 and age
        // remember if you want to use var's in a string with console.log you need `${ } ... `
        // can rewrite bio: function () {... } to just bio() {console.log ... }
        console.log(`${this.name.first} ${this.name.last} is ${this.age} years old.`);
    },
    introduceSelf() { // fourth property is a function. shows name 0
        // can rewrite introduceSelf: function() {... } to just introduceSelf() {console.log ... }
        console.log(`Hi, I"m ${this.name.first}.`);
    },
};

person.age = 45; // age was 32. is now 45.
person["name"]["last"] = "Cratchit"; // last name was Smith. is now Cratchit.

// setting members isn't just for updating values of existing properties and methods. you can also create completely new
// members

person["eyes"] = "hazel";  // new member aka property/key with a value of hazel. this is using bracket notation
person.farewell = function() { // new member aka property/key with a value of a function. this is using dot notation.
    console.log("Bye everybody!");
};

// bracket notation can be used to set not only member values dynamically, but member names too. a good use is having users
// store custom value types. in other words they can add a new member name along with that new member's value. the ex below
// is when you ask a user to create a new member named height and the user gives it a value of 1.75. bc they are being stored 
// in vars, you use [ ] to add it to your object.

const myDataName = "height"; // this is a new member name stored in a var
const myDataValue = "1.75 m"; // this is that new member's value stored in a var
person[myDataName] = myDataValue; // using bracket notation, you're adding the new member name which is referenced using the var
// myDataName and giving it a value which is also referenced using a var myDataValue. bc var's are used, you have to use bracket
// notation when creating this new member.

// adding a property using person.height (dot notation) has limitations bc it can only accept a literal member name, not a variable 
// value pointing to a name.

// after you created [myDataName]; in the console, you can see it using person.height. person["height"] also works. maybe when 
// in doubt, use [ ], seems it will always work bc dot notation has limits when you're trying to access things stored in a var.

/*  
when you type person; in the console to see the person object, you will get the below. it shows all the members and values.
the object has more members than what you started with from line 19 at the beginning of this lesson. notice there is no
[ ] for the members. [ ] are for getting and setting members and their values when they are stored in a var.

age:45
bio:ƒ bio()
eyes:"hazel"
farewell:ƒ ()
height:"1.75 m"
introduceSelf:ƒ introduceSelf()
name:{first: 'Bob', last: 'Cratchit'}
[[Prototype]]:Object

*/

/* WHAT IS "THIS"
introduceSelf() {
    console.log(`Hi, I'm ${this.name.first}.`);
};

notice this.name.first. "this" is a keyword that refers to the current object the code is being written inside. in this case, 
"this" is equivalent to person. writing it like this.name.first is the same as person.name.first. "this" is very useful
when you want to use the same method definition for every object you create.  

*/
const person1 = {
    name: "Chris",
    introduceSelf() {
        console.log(`Hello, I'm ${this.name}.`);
    },
};

const person2 = {
    name: "Deepti",
    introduceSelf() {
        console.log(`Hello, I'm ${this.name}.`);
    },
};

/* 
notice the introduceSelf() code is exactly the same for both objects. yet it outputs a different name for each introduceSelf(). 
although "this" isn't very useful when you have just one or two objects, it becomes very useful when you start using constructors
to create multiple objects from a single object definition. 

*/

/*  
INTRODUCING CONSTRUCTORS

using object literals which is the way we've been creating objects so far is useful for one or two objects. when you want to
change some properties of the object - like add a height property - then we have to update every object. we need to define the 
"shape" of an object - the set of methods and properties it can have - and then create as many objects as we like, just updating 
the values for the properties that are different.

*/

function createPerson(name) { // creates a function. it will receive a parameter called name. remember what you send it can be named
    // anything. you don't need to call it name. for ex, you can call this function like this: createPerson("John") or 
    // createPerson(someName). the function receives what is in the ( ) and uses that value for it's own internal work
    const obj = {}; // creates an object which has nothing in it
    obj.name = name; // adds a property called name and the value is what is received by the createPerson(received from elsewhere)
    obj.introduceSelf = function () { // adds a property called introduceSelf and the value is a function. this is actually a 
        // method
        console.log(`Hi, I'm ${this.name}.`); // the function prints out a message to the console.
    };

    return obj; // after all the above steps are done in the function, then it returns the newly created object.
};

// the above function creates and returns a new object. the object will have two members
// a property called name. and a method called introduceSelf() 
// createPerson() takes a parameter name to set the value of the name property, but the value of the introduceSelf() method will
// be the same for all objects created using this function. This is a very common pattern for creating objects.

const salva = createPerson("Salva"); // uses the function from above line 235 to create an object named salva with the name 
// property and the introduceSelf() method. you won't see anything in the console even though there is a console.log 
// in the object's method. it won't show until you type salva.introduceSelf. if you type salva; in the console, it will show 
// the object's properties and methods that you just created using the function.
// salva.name; // the name is already in the object. you can comment this out and the introduceSelf will still work
salva.introduceSelf(); // the method is already in the object. but it won't show until you type this out.

const frankie = createPerson("Frankie"); // similar comments as above lines 253 to 258
// frankie.name;
frankie.introduceSelf();

/* 
const frankie = createPerson("Frankie"); 
frankie.name; 
frankie.introduceSelf();

these 3 lines create an empty object, initializes it and returns it. using constructors are a better way of doing this.
a constructor is a function called using the "new" keyword. 

when you call a constructor: 

it will create a new object.
bind "this" to the new object, so you can refer to "this" in your constructor code
run the code in the constructor
return the new object

*/

function Person(name) { // constructors start with a capital letter by convention. and are named for the type of object they
    // create. this function is still creating an object even without something like "const obj = { }" as it did in line 238.
    this.name = name; // the parameter it receives is assigned to the object's property called name
    this.introduceSelf = function () { // a method showing a message in the console
        console.log(`Hi, I'm ${this.name}.`);
    };
}; 

/*
compare the Person(name) with the below createPerson(name). they look very similar to each other except the constructor 
has this.name and this.introduceSelf instead of obj.name etc. And the constructor doesn't have a line such as const obj = 
{ } which creates an empty object before having a property and method added. Also the constructor doesn't have return obj.  
then in line 310 for the const salva1 = new Person("Salva1"), the whole thing is put together. line 310 calls the function
that is doing the object creation and adding the property and method. and returns the object.
 
function createPerson(name) {  // these lines are non-constructor code. it is creating an object, then it adds a property 
    // called name and gives it a value. then it adds a method. notice that these lines use obj.name and obj.introduceSelf instead
    // of "this". whereas function Person(), the constructor, uses this.name and this.introduceSelf instead of obj.name etc.
    const obj = {}; 
    obj.name = name; 
    obj.introduceSelf = function () { 
        console.log(`Hi, I'm ${this.name}.`); 
    };

    return obj;
};
*/

// to call Person() as a constructor, we use the "new" keyword
const salva1 = new Person("Salva1"); // using the "new" keyword, this calls the Person() and uses Salva for the parameter. now
// the object has been created.
salva1.name; // you can comment this part out bc if you type salva1; in the console, it will show the new object with the name
// property with Salva1 and the new method
salva1.introduceSelf(); // this part you need bc it won't show the message until you type this

const frankie1 = new Person("Frankie1"); // similar idea as above starting at line 310
